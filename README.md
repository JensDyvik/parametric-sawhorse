Designed for CNC milling with large router type machines like ShopBot etc. You need Freecad to edit the parameters and export the parts in your preferred file format. It can be downloaded for free [here](https://www.freecadweb.org/). Download the [parametric-sawhorse.FCStd](https://github.com/JensDyvik/parametric-sawhorse/blob/main/parametric-sawhorse.FCStd) file, open it with Freecad and doublelick the *Spreadsheet* file in the treeview to edit the parameters.
